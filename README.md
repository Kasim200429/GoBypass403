## Techniques

GoBypass403 employs various techniques to bypass access controls. Here are some of the key methods:

### 1. Header Manipulation

By altering HTTP headers, you can trick the server into granting access. Common headers to manipulate include:

- User-Agent
- Referer
- Authorization

### 2. Path Traversal

This technique allows you to navigate the file system by using special characters like `..`. It can help you access restricted directories.

### 3. Unicode Normalization

Encoding payloads in different formats can help evade security filters. This includes using percent encoding and other character representations.

### 4. Rate Limiting Bypass

Some servers implement rate limiting to prevent abuse. GoBypass403 can help manage requests to avoid triggering these limits.

### 5. Session Hijacking

By exploiting session management flaws, you can gain unauthorized access to user sessions.
