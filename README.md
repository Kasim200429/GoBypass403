## Security Tool Installation

### Using Go Install (Recommended)

The quickest way to install bypass403 is with Go:

```bash
go install github.com/ibrahimsql/bypass403@latest
```

Make sure your Go bin directory is in your PATH:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

### From Source

For the latest development version or if you want to modify the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibrahimsql/bypass403.git
cd bypass403
go mod tidy  # To ensure all dependencies are correctly installed
go build
```

## Web Security Testing Usage

```
bypass403 -u https://example.com/admin -v -o results.txt
```

### Command Line Options for Security Testing

```
  -u string
        URL that returns 403 Forbidden
  -t int
        Number of concurrent threads (default 10)
  -o string
        Output file to save results
  -timeout int
        HTTP request timeout in seconds (default 10)
  -v    Verbose mode
  -all  Try all bypass techniques
  -c string
        Category of bypass techniques to try (Method, Path, Headers, IP, Encoding, Protocol, Traversal, Proxy, Advanced)
  -ua string
        User-Agent to use (default "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36")
  -w string
        Path to wordlist file for bypass attempts (default "payloads/bypasses.txt")
  -version
        Print version information and exit
```

## Security Testing Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
bypass403 -u https://example.com/admin
```

### Advanced Security Techniques

Try all techniques with a custom wordlist:
```bash
bypass403 -u https://example.com/admin -w custom_wordlist.txt -all
```

Focus on specific category of techniques:
```bash
bypass403 -u https://example.com/admin -c Headers
```

Increase verbosity and concurrent threads:
```bash
bypass403 -u https://example.com/admin -v -t 20
```

## How This Security Tool Works

1. The tool first verifies if the target URL actually returns a 403 Forbidden response
2. It then applies various bypass techniques against the target URL
3. For each technique, multiple variations are attempted
4. Successful bypasses (non-403 responses) are reported and saved
5. Results can be saved to a file for further analysis

## 403 Forbidden Bypass Techniques Explained

### Method Manipulation for Access Control Testing
Attempts to access the resource using different HTTP methods.

### Path Manipulation for Bypassing Security Controls
Modifies the URL path using various techniques like path normalization tricks.

### Header Manipulation for Web Security Assessment
Adds custom headers that might affect the server's access control decision.

### IP Spoofing Headers for Penetration Testing
Uses different headers to spoof the client's IP address as localhost or trusted IPs.

### URL Encoding Bypass Techniques
Applies different URL encoding techniques to the path.

### Protocol Bypass for Web Access Controls
Tries different protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) to access the resource.

### Path Traversal Security Testing
Uses directory traversal techniques to bypass restrictions.

### Caching Proxy Bypass Methods
Employs headers that might affect caching behavior of proxy servers.

### Advanced Security Bypass Payloads
Uses complex techniques combining multiple bypass methods.

### Wordlist-based Security Testing
Tests various paths from a wordlist.

### Combined Techniques for Comprehensive Security Assessment
Applies combinations of headers, methods, and path modifications.
