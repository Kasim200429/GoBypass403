  -o string
        Output file to save results
  -timeout int
        HTTP request timeout in seconds (default 10)
  -v    Verbose mode
  -all  Try all bypass techniques
  -c string
        Category of bypass techniques to try (Method, Path, Headers, IP, Encoding, Protocol, Traversal, Proxy, Advanced)
  -ua string
        User-Agent to use (default "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36")
  -w string
        Path to wordlist file for bypass attempts (default "payloads/bypasses.txt")
  -version
        Print version information and exit
```

## üîç 403 Forbidden Bypass Techniques Explained

### Method Manipulation for Access Control Testing
Attempts to access the resource using different HTTP methods.

### Path Manipulation for Bypassing Security Controls
Modifies the URL path using various techniques like path normalization tricks.

### Header Manipulation for Web Security Assessment
Adds custom headers that might affect the server's access control decision.

### IP Spoofing Headers for Penetration Testing
Uses different headers to spoof the client's IP address as localhost or trusted IPs.

### URL Encoding Bypass Techniques
Applies different URL encoding techniques to the path.

### Protocol Bypass for Web Access Controls
Tries different protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) to access the resource.

### Path Traversal Security Testing
Uses directory traversal techniques to bypass restrictions.

### Caching Proxy Bypass Methods
Employs headers that might affect caching behavior of proxy servers.

### Advanced Security Bypass Payloads
Uses complex techniques combining multiple bypass methods.

### Wordlist-based Security Testing
Tests various paths from a wordlist.

### Combined Techniques for Comprehensive Security Assessment
Applies combinations of headers, methods, and path modifications.

## üöÄ Security Testing Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
bypass403 -u https://example.com/admin
```

### Advanced Security Techniques

Try all techniques with a custom wordlist:
```bash
bypass403 -u https://example.com/admin -w custom_wordlist.txt -all
```

Focus on specific category of techniques:
```bash
bypass403 -u https://example.com/admin -c Headers
```

Increase verbosity and concurrent threads:
```bash
bypass403 -u https://example.com/admin -v -t 20
```
