Welcome to the official technical documentation for GoBypass403, an advanced 403 Forbidden bypass framework developed in Go. This wiki provides comprehensive information about implementation, configuration, and technical aspects of the system.

## System Architecture

GoBypass403 employs a modular architecture designed for optimal performance, extensibility, and precise execution control. Core system components include:

- **Execution Engine**: Manages concurrent operations and system resources
- **Bypass Modules**: Encapsulated implementation of bypass methodologies
- **Analysis Framework**: Processes and categorizes response data
- **Output System**: Handles result presentation and external integration
