## 👋 Welcome to GoBypass403

Hey there! I'm [ibrahimsql](https://github.com/ibrahimsql), the creator of GoBypass403. Let me tell you a bit about this project and why I built it.

## 🎯 Why GoBypass403?

During my bug bounty journey, I noticed that many security tools were either too complex or too limited when it came to testing 403 bypasses. I wanted something that was:

- **Simple**: Easy to use, no complex setup
- **Fast**: Built in Go for maximum performance
- **Effective**: Combines multiple bypass techniques
- **Open Source**: Free for everyone to use and improve

That's why I created GoBypass403 - a tool that makes 403 bypass testing accessible to everyone, from beginners to experienced security researchers.
